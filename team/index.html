                            <p>Hi! My name is Simran Kaur and I am a Junior in High School. I've always been passionate about promoting STEM among girls and giving back to the community! I have competed in many math competitions, and I am part of the math honors society and robotics team at my school. In my free time, you can catch me doing origami, practicing the piano and violin, or spending time with family and friends! Looking forward to a successful and fun year ahead!</p>

I first discovered competitive math and joined INTEGIRLS during my freshman year, but I have loved math for as long as I can remember. I love exploring intricate math fields and doing practice problems, and when I’m not doing math, I'm either playing video games, eating Buldak ramen, or running. I can’t wait to share my passion for math with other students!</p>
